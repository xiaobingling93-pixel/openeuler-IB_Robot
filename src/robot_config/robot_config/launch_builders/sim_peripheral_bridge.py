"""Peripheral bridge node generators for Gazebo simulation.

Uses ros_gz_bridge bridge_node with a YAML config file to map Gazebo sensor
topics directly to the ROS topic naming contract — no remappings= needed.

Why bridge_node instead of parameter_bridge + remappings=:
  parameter_bridge with Node(remappings=...) causes the process to start but
  fail to register with the ROS 2 daemon (processes appear in ps aux but not
  in ros2 node list), so no topics are published. bridge_node with a YAML
  config avoids this by specifying the ROS topic name directly in the config.

Topic naming contract (output ROS topics):
  /camera/{name}/image_raw
  /camera/{name}/camera_info
where {name} is YAML peripherals[].name (e.g. "top", "wrist").

This contract matches real hardware: perception.py remaps both
usb_cam and realsense2_camera outputs to the same topic names.

Gazebo sensor path construction (camera example):
  /world/{world_name}/model/{model_name}/link/{parent_frame}
    /sensor/{sensor_name}/{sensor_name}/image

where:
  world_name   = world file's <world name="..."> (fixed: "demo")
  model_name   = robot_config["name"]                    (e.g. "so101_single_arm")
  parent_frame = peripherals[].transform.parent_frame    (e.g. "base", "wrist")
  sensor_name  = f"{name}_camera"                        (e.g. "top_camera")

Why parent_frame, not frame_id:
  Ignition Gazebo 6 (gz-sim 6.x) merges fixed-joint child links into their
  parent link during URDF→SDF conversion. The camera link (frame_id, e.g.
  "camera_top_frame") is a fixed-joint child of the parent link ("base").
  After merging, the Gazebo entity path uses the parent link name:
    so101_single_arm::base::top_camera   (not ::camera_top_frame::top_camera)
  Using frame_id in the bridge path subscribes to a nonexistent Gz topic.
