"""Abstract base class for simulation backend adapters.

IB-Robot supports multiple simulation backends (Gazebo, MuJoCo) selectable
via the 'simulation.platform' field in the robot YAML configuration.

Each backend must implement all five methods. Methods that are not applicable
to a particular backend should return an empty list (e.g., spawn_peripheral_bridges
for MuJoCo, which publishes ROS topics directly without bridge nodes).

Architecture:
    YAML simulation.platform
        └── get_sim_backend(platform)          # factory in __init__.py
                └── SimBackendAdapter          # this abstract class
                        ├── GazeboAdapter      # ros_gz_bridge, Gazebo launch
                        └── MujocoAdapter      # mujoco_ros2_control (T6)
