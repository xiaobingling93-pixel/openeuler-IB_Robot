    Abstract base class for all teleoperation devices.

    All teleoperation devices (leader arms, gamepads, VR controllers, phones) must
    inherit from this class and implement the required abstract methods.

    The class provides a standardized interface for:
    - Device connection management
    - Joint target acquisition
    - Resource cleanup

    Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
    - TeleopNode is the Context
    - BaseTeleopDevice is the Strategy interface
    - Concrete devices (LeaderArmDevice, PhoneDevice) are Concrete Strategies

        _is_connected (bool): Internal connection status flag

        - Read device state (joint positions, button states, poses, etc.)
        - Apply device-specific transformations (calibration, mapping, IK)
        - Return joint-angle mapping in a standardized format

        Device-specific behaviour:
        - Leader Arm: Direct joint mapping from serial readings (returns all joints)
        - Phone: Drives MoveIt Servo for arm Cartesian control; returns only
          gripper target (arm keys absent → TeleopNode skips arm publisher)
