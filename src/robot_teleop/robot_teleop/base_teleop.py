        Read current joint targets from the teleoperation device.

        This is the core method called at each control cycle. It should:
        - Read device state (joint positions, button states, poses, etc.)
        - Apply device-specific transformations (calibration, mapping, IK)
        - Return joint-angle mapping in a standardized format

        Device-specific behavior:
        - Leader Arm: Direct joint mapping from serial readings
        - Xbox Controller: Maintain internal position state, apply delta increments
        - VR Controller: Call IK solver to convert pose → joint angles
